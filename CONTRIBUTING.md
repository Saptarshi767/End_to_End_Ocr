- Search existing issues before creating a new one
- Provide detailed information including:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - System information (OS, Python version)
  - Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Features

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/End_to_End_Ocr.git
   cd End_to_End_Ocr
   ```
3. Set up development environment:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh development
   ```
4. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where applicable
- Write comprehensive docstrings

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting

#### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_ocr_engines.py -v
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
black .

# Lint code
flake8 .

# Type checking
mypy . --ignore-missing-imports
```

### Adding New OCR Engines
1. Create engine class in `src/ocr/`
2. Implement `BaseOCREngine` interface
3. Add to `OCREngineFactory`
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation

### Adding New Features
1. Design the feature interface
2. Implement core functionality
3. Add UI components if needed
4. Write tests (aim for >80% coverage)
5. Update documentation
6. Add configuration options if applicable

### Performance Considerations
- Profile code for performance bottlenecks
- Optimize image processing operations
- Consider memory usage for large images
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Use async operations for I/O bound tasks

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical operations

### Test Data
- Use synthetic test images for consistency
- Include various image qualities and formats
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain test data in `tests/fixtures/`

### Continuous Integration
- All PRs must pass CI checks
- Tests run on multiple Python versions
- Code coverage must not decrease
- Docker builds must succeed

## 📝 Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Write clear, concise docstrings
- Include parameter and return type information
- Provide usage examples
- Document any side effects or limitations

### User Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add configuration examples
- Include troubleshooting information
- Provide performance benchmarks

### API Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include request/response examples
- Specify error conditions
- Maintain version compatibility notes

## 🚀 Release Process

### Version Numbering
