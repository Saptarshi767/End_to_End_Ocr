# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The End-to-End OCR project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: All OCR processing happens locally by default
- **No External Data Transfer**: Images are not sent to external services unless explicitly configured
- **Temporary File Cleanup**: All temporary files are automatically removed after processing
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all uploaded files and user inputs

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable timeouts
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and validation
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission system for different user roles
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all user actions

### Infrastructure Security
- **Environment Isolation**: Sandboxed processing environment
- **File Type Validation**: Only safe file types are processed
- **Size Limits**: Configurable file size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for API endpoints

## üîê Environment Security

### API Key Management
```bash
# Use the secure setup script
python setup_env.py

# Never commit .env files
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Set proper permissions
chmod 600 .env
```

### Secure Configuration
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Enable HTTPS in production environments
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Regular security updates

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All API keys are properly configured and secured
- [ ] `.env` file is not committed to version control
- [ ] File upload limits are configured appropriately
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled for production
- [ ] Database connections are encrypted
- [ ] Audit logging is enabled
- [ ] Regular backups are configured

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Monitor security advisories
- [ ] Review audit logs
- [ ] Rotate API keys periodically
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **Email us directly** at: security@example.com
4. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### Response Process
1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure with you
5. **Recognition**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (if desired)

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning
Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Container security scanning
- License compliance checking

### Manual Security Testing
We regularly perform:
- Penetration testing
- Code reviews
- Security architecture reviews
- Threat modeling

## üìö Security Resources

### Dependencies
We monitor security advisories for all dependencies:
- Python packages via `pip-audit`
- Docker base images via security scanners
- JavaScript packages (if any) via `npm audit`

### Security Tools
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis security scanner
- **Docker Scout**: Container vulnerability scanning

### Best Practices
- Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- Implement defense in depth
- Use principle of least privilege
- Regular security training for contributors

## üîÑ Security Updates

### Notification Channels
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes with security fixes
- Email notifications for critical issues

### Update Process
1. Security patches are prioritized
2. Critical vulnerabilities get immediate attention
3. Regular security updates in minor releases
4. Clear communication about security impacts

## üìû Contact Information

### Security Team
- **Email**: security@example.com
- **PGP Key**: [Link to public key]
- **Response Time**: 24 hours for acknowledgment

### General Security Questions
- **GitHub Discussions**: For general security questions
- **Documentation**: Check our security documentation
- **Community**: Ask in our community channels

## üìÑ Compliance

### Standards
- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 principles

### Privacy
- GDPR compliance ready
- Data minimization principles
- User consent management
- Right to deletion support

## üèÜ Security Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help improve our security:

### Hall of Fame
- [Researcher Name] - [Vulnerability Type] - [Date]
- [Add security researchers who have helped]

### Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- Coordinated vulnerability disclosure
- Reasonable time for fixes
- Public recognition (with permission)
- No legal action against good-faith researchers
